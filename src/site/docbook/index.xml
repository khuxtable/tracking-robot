    <para>The tracking robot is an <link
    xlink:href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</link>-based home-brew robot that
    moves towards a moving object, as detected by an ultrasonic range
    finder.</para>

    <para>At present, it is pretty basic. It just detects walls and avoids
    them.</para>

    <para>It uses a <link
    xlink:href="http://www.parallax.com/tabid/768/ProductID/92/Default.aspx">Ping)))</link>
    ultrasonic range finder, mounted in a crudely cut piece of foam core,
    which is crudely pinned to the servo horn. My plan is to use basswood or
    something like that instead of the foam core, but I had some foam core and
    I wanted to test proof of concept.</para>

    <para>The base of the robot is a wood laminate floor sample, purchased
    from a hardware store for less than a dollar. Some poplar doweling is used
    to mount the wheel servos and to provide a vertical support for the sensor
    servo and also a holder for the battery pack, which contains four AA
    cells.</para>

    <para>I used some nylon spacers to mount the Arduino duemilanove board and
    then mounted an Arduino protoshield onto that with a mini-breadboard glued
    to the protoshield. The protoshield brings the Arduino headers up and
    gives me several power and ground headers. There's an RGB LED on the board
    that I was using in an earlier version of this software for information.
    At the moment, it's unused. That may change.</para>

    <para>I'd post a circuit diagram, but there's no mystery here. Everything
    is pretty much connected straight through. The <link
    xlink:href="http://github.com/khuxtable/tracking-robot/blob/master/src/main/TrackingRobot/PinAssignments.h">PinAssignments.h</link>
    file has the pin assignments for everything.</para>

    <para>The <link
    xlink:href="http://github.com/khuxtable/tracking-robot/tree/master/src/main/TrackingRobot/">source
    sketches</link> are in a <link
    xlink:href="http://github.com/khuxtable/tracking-robot">git
    repository</link>.</para>
